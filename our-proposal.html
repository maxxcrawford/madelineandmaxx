                   <p> The only wishes Madeline had for their proposal was that it was after she graduated and that she was surprised. Maxx knew he would have to break one to grant the other. They went on a vacation to Harry Potter World over New Year’s with Madeline’s mom and sisters, in which Maxx knew he wanted to propose. He got “permission”, the perfect ring, and kept it a secret for three weeks before the trip. Madeline had no clue the entire trip, especially the day of the proposal- New Year’s Eve. Maxx even rode roller coasters all day with the ring in his pocket. He planned to propose at midnight at the bridge in front of Hogwarts.</p>
                   
                   <p>At 11:00 P.M., they got stuck on the Harry Potter rollercoaster in front of the Dementors (it was very scary). Maxx thought he might have to propose on the broken down rollercoaster. However, they managed to make it off before midnight. As they waited on the bridge in front of Hogwarts and counted down, Maxx kept trying to be sentimental and give his “speech” about his love for her, but Madeline thought it was weird that he was being lovey-dovey in public so she just looked at Hogwarts. The only way he could get her attention was by finally getting down on one knee. He had thought out every detail, even getting a ring box that lit up at night so she could see the ring in the dark.</p> <h3>It was the most perfect moment, with laughing and crying.</h3>
