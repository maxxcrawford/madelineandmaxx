                   <p>Madeline is a 22-year-old recent graduate from the University of Tulsa, now working at a fantastic design firm (Byers Creative) in Tulsa, Oklahoma. She has the most supportive and fun family, William, Becky, Jacqlyn, and Kylie, as well as the most perfect friends a girl could ask for (both old and new). She loves her puppies, photography, parties, Twitter, travel, Tulsa, and Maxx. Her favorite memory with Maxx is the entire weekend at Harry Potter World leading up to the surprise proposal.</p>
                   <p>Maxx is a 24-year-old graphic designer from Mena, Arkansas. He graduated from the University of Arkansas-Fort Smith in 2010, and moved to Tulsa in January 2011, and is now working at a web development firm, <a href=“http://www.spherexx.com” target=“_blank”> Spherexx.com </a>. His family, Robert, Donita, and Courtney, is entertaining and loving. His hobbies include running, cycling, music, technology, and beer. Aside from proposing, one of his favorite memories of Madeline is playing on the beach at South Padre.</p>
                   
                  <p>The first time they met was technically January 1, 2009 (and exactly three years later he proposed), but they really met as “wing” people to their best friends about a month after. Madeline went to a party at Maxx’s apartment where they tried to out-talk each other about design. Two weeks later, they went to Austin’s birthday party in Springdale together and since then, have not gone a day without speaking. Two years in a long distance relationship with countless miles driven and hours on the phone, Maxx moved to Tulsa. They have traveled to several cities across the country, made tons of new friends, and adopted the best puppies (Peeta and Marsala) ever.</p>
